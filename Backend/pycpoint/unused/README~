pycpoint
========
            
Python Control Point is a UPnP control point for audio files and streams.

It is built on top of the BRisa UPnP framework, with extensions added
for Sonos ZonePlayers and the content they can serve/render.

Dependencies:
-------------
Python 2.5 or later
PyGTK, Python-gobject, PyGlade - http://www.pygtk.org/
python-brisa - http://brisa.garage.maemo.org/installation.html
    python-brisa Framework 0.10.0
    python-brisa Qt Reactor 0.10.0
(python-brisa requires one of the following:
    * (Recommended)* Python-circuits - http://trac.softcircuit.com.au/circuits/
    * Python-paste - http://pythonpaste.org
    * Python-cherrypy 3.1.1 - www.cherrypy.org)

To play files locally on the machine running pycpoint:
    gstreamer 0.10+ - http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download
    gmediarender-0.0.6 - 
    (you can also use BRisa Media Renderer - http://brisa.garage.maemo.org/installation.html)


Installation:
-------------
Untar the source into your directory of choice. Currently the source contains changes to the BRisa framework 
that are held in a brisa directory within the pycpoint directory. These will be correctly picked up in 
preference to BRisa code if pycpoint is run from the pycpoint directory.

Run:
----
Run
    python pycpoint.py or ./pycpoint.py
    
from the pycpoint directory - you should see a GUI that allows selection and browsing of UPnP servers 
on the local network and selection of UPnP renderers on the same network to play content on.

There are command line options for debug such as -d to get it all or -m<module> for distinct modules.
Note that you may have to initially run brisa-conf to set the error level to debug to see debug output.

New features in 0.2
-------------------
1) Next and Previous buttons enabled.
2) Pause and Stop enabled for use with brisa-media-renderer. Now Playing also enabled for this.
3) Music location moved from status bar to separate window accessed by info button (displays res tags
for music, URI/URL(s) for RadioTime, also displays item XML). Info window updates are asynchronous.
4) Music served from Sonos can now be rendered locally via BRisa renderer.
5) Add to queue enabled for both container and media list entries.
6) Playlist rename support.
7) Twonky support.
8) Context sensitive right click (more work to do here).

Bugs fixed in 0.2
-----------------
1) now_playing window not destroyed correctly so unable to open a new one
2) Doubleclick on medialist entry didn't always select track first time
3) Out of sequence NOTIFY messages causing now playing to be out of date

Known bugs/features:
--------------------
This is alpha software, it still crashes and may wipe you Sonos queue (so make sure you save it first).

1) Currently when selecting a title in the media list, the location of that item is displayed in the
status bar. When that item is a radio stream, 2 HTTP calls are needed to get the information. These
calls take a little time so the GUI refresh takes time too. Double clicking to play such content does 
not always work first time. **** FIXED in 0.2 (moved to separate async window).
2) The "Add to queue" option when right clicking on a container is not yet activated. **** FIXED in 0.2.
3) Deezer and Napster options are not yet activated.
4) Reopening the "Now Playing" window by selecting a different renderer after manually closing that window 
causes the app to hang. **** FIXED in 0.2.
5) There is currently no persistence for browse - all browses use HTTP calls to get music data from the
server they are querying. Calls are chunked to avoid flooding the network/server.
6) Containers served by third party servers show in the Sonos queue as filenames (note that the metadata 
is displayed if you select them).
7) Volume control sends too many updates and consequently is hard to set.
