Python changes:


#### TODO: copy the code in site-packages back to source OTHERWISE a re-install will lose it


1) Created Sonos dir and copied control_point_gtk.py and control_point_gtk.glade in.

2) (Undid this change).

3) control_point_gtk.py
	Added code into on_new_device to walk through child devices as ZonePlayer has them.

4) added some debug output to /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/brisa/control_point/control_point_av.py - browse method is failing to create a SOAPService. This is because it's attempting to access the root device rather than the child - added code in to ####

5) Created chop.py and log.py. chop.py contains a function (chop) to chop a string into multiple lines (size passed as param), as well as a function (csplit) to split a string into multiple tokens. log.py overrides LogRecord.getMessage and calls chop and cstring so that DEBUG log messages are formatted better on screen. It also replaces BRisa.log - note that it calls set_level with DEBUG and stdout and doesn't get those values from the config file. Both control_point_av and control_point_gtk have been amended to import the new log instead of the BRisa one.


........others to add........

later) Compiled/installed glade 3.6 from source. Needed GTK+ 2.0 plus lots of other dependencies (xml2po was a bugger, is hidden in a docs-utils package).
